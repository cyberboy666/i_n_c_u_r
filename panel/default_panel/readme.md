# i_n_c_u_r default_panel notes

- the mounting holes fit m3 screws
- the front_panel mounts to pcb with 15mm standoffs
- 45mm screws will fit front_panel, pcb, raspberry_pi_3 and back_plate
- power is provided via 5v 1.5A micro_usb directly to raspberry pi
- the default potentiometers in underscores BOMs have 12mm shaft lengths - due to 15mm standoff you will need to replace these with >17mm shaft length alternatives if you plan to use it with a panel
